Velocicopter
====================

Submission for [Ludum Dare 32 Game Jam](https://ludumdare.com)

Use WASD or the arrow keys to move and space to shoot. The objective of the game is to kill as many velicopters as possible 
before dying. You cannot walk through the walls but because the walls are shoulder height velociraptors can jump over them
and you can also shoot over them. Get a new weapon by walking on a weapon box tile which will have a question mark on it.
