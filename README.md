Velocicopter

Submission for [Ludum Dare 32 Game Jam](https://ludumdare.com/ludumdare32)

[Download and play the game here!](https://github.com/VersatileVelociraptors/LD32/releases/download/v1.0/Velocicopter.zip)

Use WASD or the arrow keys to move and space to shoot. The objective of the game is to kill as many velocirapters as possible 
before dying. You cannot walk through the walls but because the walls are shoulder height velociraptors, being versatile, can
jump over them and you can also shoot over them. Get a new weapon by walking on a weapon box tile which will have a question mark on it.
